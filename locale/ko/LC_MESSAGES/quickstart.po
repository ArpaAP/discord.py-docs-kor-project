"This page gives a brief introduction to the library. It assumes you have "
"the library installed, if you don't check the :ref:`installing` portion."
msgstr "이 페이지는 라이브러리에 대한 간결한 소개를 합니다. 라이브러리가 설치되있다고 가정하므로, 만약에 그렇지 않다면 :ref:`installing` 항목을 확인해주세요."

"Let's name this file ``example_bot.py``. Make sure not to name it "
"``discord.py`` as that'll conflict with the library."

"We then use the :meth:`Client.event` decorator to register an event. This"
" library has many events. Since this library is asynchronous, we do "
"things in a \"callback\" style manner."
msgstr ""

#: ../../quickstart.rst:49
msgid ""
"A callback is essentially a function that is called when something "
"happens. In our case, the :func:`on_ready` event is called when the bot "
"has finished logging in and setting things up and the :func:`on_message` "
"event is called when the bot has received a message."
msgstr ""

#: ../../quickstart.rst:52
msgid ""
"Since the :func:`on_message` event triggers for *every* message received,"
" we have to make sure that we ignore messages from ourselves. We do this "
"by checking if the :attr:`Message.author` is the same as the "
":attr:`Client.user`."

#: ../../quickstart.rst:55
msgid ""
"Afterwards, we check if the :class:`Message.content` starts with "
"``'$hello'``. If it is, then we reply in the channel it was used in with "
"``'Hello!'``."

"Finally, we run the bot with our login token. If you need help getting "
"your token or creating a bot, look in the :ref:`discord-intro` section."

"Now that we've made a bot, we have to *run* the bot. Luckily, this is "
