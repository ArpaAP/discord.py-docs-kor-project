"We then use the :meth:`Client.event` decorator to register an event. This"
" library has many events. Since this library is asynchronous, we do "
"things in a \"callback\" style manner."

#: ../../quickstart.rst:49
msgid ""
"A callback is essentially a function that is called when something "
"happens. In our case, the :func:`on_ready` event is called when the bot "
"has finished logging in and setting things up and the :func:`on_message` "
"event is called when the bot has received a message."

#: ../../quickstart.rst:52
msgid ""
"Since the :func:`on_message` event triggers for *every* message received,"
" we have to make sure that we ignore messages from ourselves. We do this "
"by checking if the :attr:`Message.author` is the same as the "
":attr:`Client.user`."

#: ../../quickstart.rst:55

"Afterwards, we check if the :class:`Message.content` starts with "
"``'$hello'``. If it is, then we reply in the channel it was used in with "
"``'Hello!'``."

"Finally, we run the bot with our login token. If you need help getting "

"Now that we've made a bot, we have to *run* the bot. Luckily, this is "
